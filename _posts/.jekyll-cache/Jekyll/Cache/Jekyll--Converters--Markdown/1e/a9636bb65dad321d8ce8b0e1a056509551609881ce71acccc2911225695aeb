I"O"<p>The binomial model is a simple method for determining the prices of options.</p>

<h2 id="basic-binomial-model-assumptions">Basic binomial model assumptions</h2>

<p>The binomial model makes a few simplifying assumptions (here, we’ll assume the underlying asset is a stock):</p>
<ul>
  <li>In a given time interval, a stock price can only make two types of moves: up or down. Furthermore, each of these moves is by a fixed amount.</li>
  <li>All time intervals are discretized.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these assumptions are fairly unrealistic, the model can be a good starting point for understanding more complex models. The binomial model is a discrete-time approximation to other, more interesting models, so it’s a good place to start. (Note that below we sometimes drop the $ sign to avoid notational clutter.)</p>

<h2 id="starting-example">Starting example</h2>

<p>Consider a call option $V$ for a stock $S$ that is currently worth $100. Recall that the earnings from a call option will be positive for increases in the underlying’s value, but will be 0 for a decrease in the underlying stock. The earnings from a call option can be visualized in the plot below:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/call_option.png" alt="call_option" /></p>

<p>If the stock goes up by 1 tomorrow, the option is worth 1. If the stock goes down by 1 tomorrow, the option is worth 0.</p>

<p>The main question is: how much is the option worth today?</p>

<p>Without knowing anything else about the situation or the market, it seems like the answer will depend on the probability $p$ that the stock will go up (and equivalently the probability $1-p$ that it will go down). Indeed, the expected value of the option is 
\(\mathbb{E}[V] = px,\)
where $x$ is the amount the stock could go up tomorrow. In this case $x=1$, so $\mathbb{E}[V] = p$.</p>

<p>However, due to the opportunity for investors to hedge their bets, this reasoning is faulty.</p>

<p>Consider the case when $p=0.2$, and the option costs $0.20$. Suppose an investor buys the call option $V$ and simultaneously takes a short position in $\frac12$ of the stock $S$, which costs $\frac12(100)=50$ in this case. Then this portfolio $P$ is worth 
\(P = \underbrace{0.2}_{\text{option}} - \underbrace{50}_{\text{short}}=-49.8.\) How much will the portfolio be worth tomorrow? There are two scenarios:</p>

<p>\begin{align} &amp;\text{$S$ increases by 1} \implies P = 1-\frac12(101)=-49.50. \\ &amp;\text{$S$ decreases by 1} \implies P = 0-\frac12(99)=-49.50. \end{align}</p>

<p>In either case, the portfolio will be worth $49.50$. If the investor were to buy back the short position tomorrow, he or she would have gained $0.30$ without assuming any risk at all. This is an arbitrage opportunity.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the option costs $0.50$ initially, then the initial portfolio is worth $49.50$, and there is no opportunity for riskless profit.</p>

<h2 id="interest-rates">Interest rates</h2>

<p>In practice, there is another, simpler way to make a risk-free profit: through the risk-free interest rate (usually approximated by bonds). The return on these bonds is the interest rate. Thus, we should factor this opportunity into the calculation of the option price.</p>

<p>Denote the interest rate as $r$. (For simplicity, we’ll assume $r$ is the daily return.) If we currently own $50$ in cash, then by buying bonds, we could have a portfolio worth $50(1+r)$ tomorrow without assuming any risk. Thus, we should discount tomorrow’s portfolio value by $\frac{1}{1+r}$ to account for this.</p>

<p>In the example above, this would mean</p>

<p>\begin{align} &amp;V - \frac12(100) = -49.5\left(\frac{1}{1+r}\right) \\ \implies&amp; (1+r)(V-50) = -49.5 \\ \implies&amp; V-50+rV-50r=-49.5 \\ \implies&amp; V=\frac{0.5+50r}{1+r} \end{align}</p>

<p>As an example, consider when $r=10^{-3}$. Plugging into the above, this implies that $V=0.504945$. Intuitively it makes sense that the option should cost slightly more than the no-interest case because the projected portfolio value tomorrow, \(-49.5\left(\frac{1}{1+10^{-3}}\right) = -49.495,\)
which is a gain of $0.005$.</p>

<p>By simply working with bonds, our portfolio value would have been:
\(50(1+10^{-3}) = 50.005\)
for an equal gain of $0.005$.</p>

<h2 id="more-general-form">More general form</h2>

<p>Suppose the current time is $t$ and we’re considering the price of an option that expires at the next time step $t + \delta t$. The current stock price is $S$. There are two scenarios for the next time step:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The stock price rises to $uS$, and the option price rises to $V^+$, making the portfolio worth $V^+ - \Delta uS$.</li>
  <li>The stock price falls to $vS$, and the option price falls to $V^-$, making the portfolio worth $V^- - \Delta vS$.</li>
</ul>

<p>To figure out how much of the stock to short (represented by $\Delta$ here), we must hedge so that these two possible portfolios have equal value.
\begin{align} &amp;V^+ - \Delta uS = V^- - \Delta vS \\ \implies&amp; \Delta = \frac{V^+ - V^-}{uS - vS}. \end{align}
We can think of this quantity as a discrete approximation to “Delta”, or the sensitivity of the option to the change in the underlying stock price, 
\(\frac{V^+ - V^-}{uS - vS} \to \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} ~~~\text{as}~~~ \delta t \to 0.\)</p>

<p>The portfolio’s value at $t+\delta t$ then has two equivalent forms:
\begin{align} P_{t + \delta t} &amp;= V^+ - u \frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v} \\ P_{t + \delta t} &amp;= V^- - v \frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v}. \end{align}
To account for nonzero interest rates, this portfolio value must also be equal to the amount that could be earned just through the risk-free interest rate. Recall that if the interest rate is $r$ and the current value of the portfolio is $P$, then the value of the portfolio that just earns based on the interest rate at $t + \delta t$ is
\(P_{t + \delta t} = P + Pr\delta t = P(1 + r \delta t)\)
where $P = V-\Delta S$ is the original value of the portfolio.</p>

<p>Setting this value equal to the portfolio under the option investment, we have
\begin{align} &amp;P(1 + r \delta t) = V^+ - u \frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v} \\ \implies&amp; (V-\Delta S) (1 + r \delta t) = V^+ - u \frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v} \\ \implies&amp; \left(V-\left(\frac{V^+ - V^-}{uS - vS}\right) S\right) (1 + r \delta t) = V^+ - u \frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v} \\ \implies&amp; V(1 + r \delta t) - \left(\frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v}\right) (1 + r \delta t) = V^+ - u \frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v} \\ \implies&amp; V(1 + r \delta t) = \left(\frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v}\right) (1 + r \delta t) + V^+ - u \frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v} \\ \implies&amp; V(1 + r \delta t) = \left(\frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v}\right) (1 + r \delta t) + \frac{u V^+ - v V^+}{u-v} - \frac{uV^+ - uV^-}{u - v} \\ \implies&amp; V(1 + r \delta t) = \left(\frac{V^+ - V^-}{u - v}\right) (1 + r \delta t) + \frac{uV^- - vV^+}{u - v} \\ \end{align}</p>

<p>Suppose we choose to model the stock’s behavior as a random walk, where
\(S_{t+\delta t} \sim \mathcal{N}(S_t + \mu \delta t, \sigma^2 S_t^2 \delta t)\)</p>

<p>We can then choose</p>

<p>\begin{align} u &amp;= 1 + \sigma \sqrt{\delta t} \\ v &amp;= 1 - \sigma \sqrt{\delta t} \\ p &amp;= \frac12 + \frac{\mu \sqrt{\delta t}}{2\sigma} \end{align}</p>

<p>Plugging these values into the equation for the option price, we have
\begin{align} &amp;V(1 + r \delta t) = \left(\frac{V^+ - V^-}{(1 + \sigma \sqrt{\delta t}) - (1 - \sigma \sqrt{\delta t})}\right) (1 + r \delta t) + \frac{(1 + \sigma \sqrt{\delta t})V^- - (1 - \sigma \sqrt{\delta t})V^+}{(1 + \sigma \sqrt{\delta t}) - (1 - \sigma \sqrt{\delta t})} \\ \implies&amp; V(1 + r \delta t) = \left(\frac{V^+ - V^-}{2\sigma \sqrt{\delta t}}\right) (1 + r \delta t) + \frac{V^- + \sigma \sqrt{\delta t} V^- - V^+ + \sigma \sqrt{\delta t} V^+}{2\sigma \sqrt{\delta t}} \\ \implies&amp; V(1 + r \delta t) = V^+\left( \frac{1}{2\sigma \sqrt{\delta t}}  + \frac{r \sqrt{\delta t}}{2 \sigma} - \frac{1}{2 \sigma \sqrt{\delta t}} + \frac12 \right) + V^- \left( -\frac{1}{2\sigma \sqrt{\delta t}} - \frac{r\sqrt{\delta t}}{2\sigma} + \frac{1}{2\sigma \sqrt{\delta t}} + \frac12 \right) \\ \implies&amp; V(1 + r \delta t) = V^+ \underbrace{\left( \frac{r \sqrt{\delta t}}{2 \sigma} + \frac12 \right)}_{p} + V^- \underbrace{\left( - \frac{r\sqrt{\delta t}}{2\sigma} + \frac12 \right)}_{1-p} \end{align}
The quantities $p$ and $1-p$ labeled with brackets above can be seen as the “risk-neutral probabilities”. In simple terms, these are the “probabilities” under which, if the stock obeyed them, the portfolio would have equal value at step $t+\delta t$ regardless of the direction of movement.</p>
