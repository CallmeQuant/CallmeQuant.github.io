       Hi, I'm Binh. Welcome to my little corner of the web.
   </p>
   <p>
       I'm currently making my way through a Master's in Mathematical Statistics. I was drawn to this field, and its intersection with machine learning, because it offers a language to ask better questions about the world. 
       My interests have naturally gravitated toward time series and high-dimensional statistics, where the challenge of untangling complex data into something understandable is a puzzle I truly enjoy.
   </p>
   <p>
       My approach to learning and research is deeply influenced by a simple idea from Richard Feynman, which has become a compass for me:
   </p>
   <blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1em; margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic;">
       "I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something."
   </blockquote>
   <p>
       To me, this captures the heart of the research journey. It's a humbling and determined process of moving past just knowing the names of models and methods, and instead, striving to grasp the fundamental ideas underneath. It's a path that requires resilience, especially through the inevitable dead ends, but the pursuit of that deeper, more honest understanding is what keeps me going.
   </p>
    <p>
       Here, I'll be sharing some of my work and thoughts from that journey. Thanks for stopping by.
