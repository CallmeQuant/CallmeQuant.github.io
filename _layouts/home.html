       Hi, I'm Binh. Welcome to my little corner of the web.
   </p>
   <p>
       I'm currently making my way through Master study in Mathematical Statistics, drawn to its intersection with machine learning because it offers a precise language for asking better questions about the world. 
       My interests gravitate toward time series and high-dimensional statistics, where the challenge lies in distilling complex, noisy data into meaningful structure.
   </p>
   <p>
       My work draws on learning theory and tools from high-dimensional statistics to design models with solid theoretical foundations. I explore topics ranging from state-space models and probabilistic modeling to deep generative approaches for sequential data and modeling frameworks for complex domains such as biological systems.
   </p>
   <p>
       I'm guided by a simple idea from Richard Feynman:
   </p>
   <blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1em; margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic;">
       "I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something."
   </blockquote>
   <p>
       For me, research is about moving beyond knowing names of models to understanding the ideas beneath them. It's a humbling process that requires patience through dead ends, but the pursuit of that deeper understanding is what keeps me going.
   </p>
   <p>
       Here, I share some of my projects, notes, and reflections from that journey. Thanks for visiting.
